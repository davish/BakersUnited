# BakersUnited
This player competed in MIT's 2015 [Battlecode](http://www.battlecode.org/) (IAP 6.370) competition. 

After winning its first three matches in the Sprint Tournament, the player lost in its second and third rounds of the Qualifying tournament.

Making the player was actually a lot of fun, and I learned a lot doing it. Hopefully I'll be back next year with a better pathing algorithm!
